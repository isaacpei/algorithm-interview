# Maximum Rectangles

## Description
Alice have several rectangles, and she wants to play the "Maximum Rectangles" game.

The game is like this:  
1. if two rectangles share common point, replace them with a smallest rectangle, which covers these two rectangles.
2. repeat 1 until no rectangles share common point.

## Input:
A list of lists, each list in it contains 4 integers: [u, d, l, r].

## Ouput
Also a list of lists, the maximum rectangles.

## Example
for input:
```
[
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 4, 5],
    [3, 2, 2, 5],
    [2, 1, 5, 6]
]
```
the output is:
```
[
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [3, 0, 2, 6]
]
```

## Notice
1. What's the time complexity for your solution?
2. For this question, I hope you can solve it within 40 mins.
